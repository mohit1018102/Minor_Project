# Prediction Of Lithofacies using Machine learning Algorithms
This prediction problem comes under the classification problem (Supervised learning). In this project i have developed a GUI-application which will run the different algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbours, Naive Baye's, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random forest. Among these algorithms best algorithm is selected (Algorithm is selected according to the accuracy percentage).
